                            Drive Insight was born in 2024 from the shared
                            passion of two car enthusiasts, Ninad and Yug. As
                            graduates of Arizona State University, they combined
                            their technical expertise with their love for
                            automobiles to create something unique - an
                            application that gives drivers deep insights into
                            their driving behavior while maintaining absolute
                            data privacy.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The journey began with Ninad's prototype in Python
                            two years ago, driven by a curiosity to understand
                            fuel consumption during peak gas prices. This early
                            experiment evolved into something much more
                            ambitious.
